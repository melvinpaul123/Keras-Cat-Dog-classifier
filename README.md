# Keras-Cat-Dog-classifier
This project utilizes keras and tensorflow to train a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs with relatively high accuracy. <br/>
I achieved a 88% accuracy with this model.<br/>
The data set for the project can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/melvinpauljacob/cat-dog-dataset <br/>
Unzip the rar file before use.<br/>
Before running the code download the following libraries: <br/>
1.Keras<br/>
2.Tensorflow 2.0 or greater<br/>
3.sklearn<br/>
4.OpenCV<br/>
5.matplotlib<br/>
6.numpy<br/>
<br/>
I hope this will be usefull to you.
