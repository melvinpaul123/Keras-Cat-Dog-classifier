# Keras-Cat-Dog-classifier
This project utilizes keras and tensorflow to train a CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs with relatively high accuracy. 
I achieved a 88% accuracy with this model.
The data set for the project can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/melvinpauljacob/cat-dog-dataset
Unzip the rar file before use.
Before running the code download the following libraries: <br/>
1.Keras
2.Tensorflow 2.0 or greater
3.sklearn
4.OpenCV
5.matplotlib
6.numpy

I hope this will be usefull to you.
